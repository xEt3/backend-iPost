# Swimlanes are in Production!  

Swimlanes divide a Kanban board into horizontal bands.  Each lane can represent a person, group, or any other useful category for organizing and segmenting your cards.  

## To Add Swimlanes
Click the **`Lists`** button (near the top right) to switch to the Swimlanes view. The **`Add Swimlane`** button is at far right of the lists.  You may have to scroll horizontally to the right and minimize the righthand sidebar to see it.

## To Rename Swimlanes
You can change the name of a swimlane name by clicking the name.  You may have to scroll all the way to the left, if your page is wider than the screen.

## To Reorder Swimlanes
You can reorder any swimlane by clicking (and holding) the name-area of the swimlane (on the left) and dragging it up or down into a new position.

## To Archive Swimlanes
You can archive any swimlane by clicking on the hamburger button (3 horizontal stacked lines).  It is directly above the name of the swimlane on the left of the lane.  You may have to scroll all the way to the left, if your page is wider than the screen.

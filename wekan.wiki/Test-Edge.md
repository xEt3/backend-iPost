## Testers to ping with new Wekan Edge release
- All those whose issues were fixed [at ChangeLog](https://github.com/wekan/wekan/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md)
- @saschafoerster

Those should reply to new issue that has name `Test Edge Wekan (version-number-here)` at https://github.com/wekan/wekan/issues .

## Why test?

https://github.com/wekan/wekan/issues/2811

## Who should test
- If you are the person in your company that gets yelled at when something breaks in new version of Wekan.
- If you think xet7 releasing new version of Wekan every day directly to stable production Snap channel is in any way risky.

## What usually happens when Wekan gets broken

1. There is many new issues about some same new feature or bug. Yes, also when some notices new feature that is already [at ChangeLog](https://github.com/wekan/wekan/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md), they add issue about it, usually asking "Can this feature be turned off or made optional?". This is usually if new feature changes some old workflow radically.
2. Many do tag @xet7 that are you aware of the issue.
3. Someone yells at IRC that "this is too much, it's time to fork Wekan". Well, that's because he gets yelled at by all users of Wekan at his company.
4. xet7 does not have time to answer those, he just fixes the issue - usually at the same day, makes new release, closes all related issues with last comment "Please try Wekan (version-number-here)".
5. There is [only one comment](https://github.com/wekan/wekan/issues/2812#issuecomment-555860032) that says "This resolved things for me. Thanks for such a quick fix. This is an invaluable piece of software for me!"
6. xet7 thinks this is great normal development day: Got some features added, got some bugs fixes, and happily goes to sleep well. This is because above 1-5 has happened many times before, it's just normal.

## ChangeLog

## Backup before testing. And backup daily in production.

Why? Well, Wekan has no undo yet. If you delete Swimlane/List/Card, it's gone.
That's why it's harder to reach in submenu. It's better to Arhive those,
and unarchive.

You could test at other computer than your production.

## Snap

Snap has automatic update, or you can update manually:
```
sudo snap refresh
```
You see at https://snapcraft.io/wekan what are current versions.

To change to Edge:
```
sudo snap refresh wekan --edge --amend
```
And back to stable:
```
sudo snap refresh wekan --stable --amend
```

## Docker

`docker-compose.yml` is at https://github.com/wekan/wekan .

### Latest development version from master branch

Quay:
```
image: quay.io/wekan/wekan
```
Docker Hub:
```
image: wekanteam/wekan
```

### Example of using release tags

[Quay tags](https://quay.io/repository/wekan/wekan?tag=latest&tab=tags):
```
image: quay.io/wekan/wekan:v3.55
```
[Docker Hub tags](https://hub.docker.com/r/wekanteam/wekan/tags):
```
image: wekanteam/wekan:v3.55
```

### How to change Docker version

1) Backup first
https://github.com/wekan/wekan/wiki/Backup

```
docker-compose stop
docker rm wekan-app
```
2) Change version tag. Then:
```
docker-compose up -d
```

### Build Docker version from source

At docker-compose.yml is these lines:

```
    #-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
    # ==== BUILD wekan-app DOCKER CONTAINER FROM SOURCE, if you uncomment these ====
    # ==== and use commands: docker-compose up -d --build
    #build:
    #  context: .
    #  dockerfile: Dockerfile
    #  args:
    #    - NODE_VERSION=${NODE_VERSION}
    #    - METEOR_RELEASE=${METEOR_RELEASE}
    #    - NPM_VERSION=${NPM_VERSION}
    #    - ARCHITECTURE=${ARCHITECTURE}
    #    - SRC_PATH=${SRC_PATH}
    #    - METEOR_EDGE=${METEOR_EDGE}
    #    - USE_EDGE=${USE_EDGE}
    #-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
```
Uncomment from those this way:
```
    build:
      context: .
      dockerfile: Dockerfile
      args:
        - NODE_VERSION=${NODE_VERSION}
        - METEOR_RELEASE=${METEOR_RELEASE}
        - NPM_VERSION=${NPM_VERSION}
        - ARCHITECTURE=${ARCHITECTURE}
        - SRC_PATH=${SRC_PATH}
        - METEOR_EDGE=${METEOR_EDGE}
        - USE_EDGE=${USE_EDGE}
```
Then start Wekan to http://localhost this way:
```
docker-compose up -d --build
```

## Sandstorm

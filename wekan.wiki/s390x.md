[xet7](https://github.com/xet7), as maintainer of [Wekan](https://wekan.github.io), got access to mainframe at IBM LinuxOne Community Cloud. There are access to SUSE and RHEL 7 servers, so this Wekan version has been tested on RHEL7. Access to those servers is monitored, it's running on a real mainframe. On that s390x server it is possible to download repos directly from GitHub, but building directly on those servers is not possible, because access to npm etc package repos in not at whitelist. There are no open ports to Internet at LinuxOne Community Cloud provided server.
